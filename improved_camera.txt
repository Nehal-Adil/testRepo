Dual Camera on my Device.

The major new feature in the iPhone 11 was an upgraded dual-lens camera system. It includes an ƒ/1.8 6-element 12-megapixel wide-angle lens (26mm focal length) and an ƒ/2.4 5-element 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle lens (13mm focal length), up from a single 12-megapixel camera lens in the iPhone XR.
